### 4. Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- **React.js:** Core JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server for React projects.
- **React Router DOM (v6):** For efficient client-side routing and navigation.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for API requests, configured with interceptors for JWT injection and global error handling.
- **Plain CSS:** Custom styling using CSS variables, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries.
- **`localStorage`:** Used for simple client-side storage of JWT, User ID, and Role for authentication state persistence.

**Backend (Backend Knowledge Transfer Summary for Frontend Developers):**

- **Node.js/Express.js API:** Provides the RESTful endpoints consumed by the frontend.
- **API Base URL:** All requests target `http://localhost:3000/sm`.
- **API Response Structure:** Consistent JSON format `{ "status": "success" | "fail" | "error", "message": "...", "data": { ... } }`.
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Standard HTTP codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 424, 500) are handled, with special attention to 401/403 (authentication) and 424 (failed external dependency for product registration).
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication where token is sent in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **Date Formats:** Dates sent to backend as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; received as `YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO strings and formatted for display.

### 5. Design & User Experience Principles

The frontend adheres to a strict set of design principles to ensure a coherent and positive user experience:

- **Clarity and Simplicity:** UI is straightforward, avoiding visual clutter, complex animations, or unnecessary effects. Focus on direct user interaction.
- **Consistent Theme:** A primary color palette of purple and white is maintained throughout the application. Purple is used for accents, interactive elements (buttons, links, headings), while white serves as the dominant background.
- **Responsiveness:** The layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure basic usability on all devices. Tables use `overflow-x: auto` for horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and clickable elements are clearly identifiable and provide visual feedback for states such as hover, active, and disabled. Buttons indicate loading states with text changes (e.g., "Submitting...").
- **Form Input Feedback:** Validation errors are clearly communicated using a red border around the invalid input field combined with a specific error message text directly below the field.
- **Data Table Readability:** Tables feature subtle alternating row background colors and clear border lines for improved data scanning and readability.
- **Visual Cues:** Minimalist SVG icons are integrated directly into components where they significantly enhance clarity (e.g., for actions or status indicators) without relying on external icon libraries.

### 6. Current Development Status

The Smart Munim Ji frontend application has reached **Version 1.0.0**, signifying the completion of all initially specified features and functionalities.

The application is now ready for comprehensive testing (QA, UAT) against the backend API.

### 7. Future Enhancements & Roadmap

While the core functionality is complete, the following areas are identified for future enhancements and form the basis of the development roadmap:

- **Advanced Form Handling:** Implement a dedicated form management library (e.g., React Hook Form) for more efficient state management, validation, and error display in complex forms.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness:** Explore more sophisticated responsive patterns for data tables (e.g., converting rows to cards on mobile) and other dynamic layouts where simple scrolling might not suffice.
- **Global Notification System:** Implement a unified toast/snackbar notification system for consistent, non-intrusive user feedback for successful operations.
- **Search, Filtering, and Pagination:** Add robust search, filtering, and pagination capabilities to all data-heavy lists (e.g., Registered Products, Claims, User Management) to improve usability for large datasets.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement React performance optimizations (e.g., `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) and lazy loading for components to improve initial load times and runtime efficiency.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Integrate best practices for web accessibility, including ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Unit & Integration Testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests for individual components and integration tests for key user flows to ensure reliability and facilitate continuous development.
